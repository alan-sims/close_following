# Close Following Behavior Analysis

Analysis of close following behavior across four scenarios comparing highway vs rural environments and being tailgated vs tailgating roles.

## Scenarios

- [Highway - Being Tailgated](docs/highway_being_tailgated.md)
- [Highway - Tailgating](docs/highway_tailgating.md) 
- [Rural - Being Tailgated](docs/rural_being_tailgated.md)
- [Rural - Tailgating](docs/rural_tailgating.md)

## Research Questions

1. How does road environment (highway vs rural) affect close following behavior?
2. How does following role (being tailgated vs tailgating) change driver responses?
3. What are the interaction effects between road type and following role?
4. Which scenarios present the highest stress and safety risks?

## Data Structure

- Time-series data sampled at 0.05-second intervals (20 Hz)
- File format: Tab-separated CSV with complex column names
